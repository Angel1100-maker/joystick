# Joystick Profiler Utility

This utility is there in the current state to help, to quickly make the basic joystick Mappings for DCS world (Digital Combat Simulator).
It works by making relations between various inputs from various planes and bind them to the same place on the joystick.

You first create Relations. Within a single relation each airframe can only be once bound/active. Multiple different DCS key elements can conclude one relation. 
E.g. You have in some airframes Left Wheel Brake and a right Wheel brake. In some others you just have a Wheel break. So you can make now a relation that you would want on your
right paddle the right wheel brake and for those airframes that just have a general brake you want the general break there. 

You can export Relations to make other Peoples life easier, so they don't need to make Relations. 
Once you are happy with your Relation you can Bind an Axis or Button to it. 
However for simplicity sake the current version has some shortcomings, because I am not sure if i just coded that for me, or if more people find interest in such a utility.

If people show interest, I might update it and improve on the given shortcomings and improve the cleaness of the code and maybe extend to other games like Star citizen, but as I said for me it does the job right now. 
Use the program only at your own risk as you might overwrite some existing binds. Make some backup of your existing binds before you use the software, if you get disappointed, that you can roll back.

Anyways Good Success and Have a nice day.

# FAQ:
I have mods installed, but they do not show up in relations?
and
DCS got updated Keybinds but it is not showing them?
Go into DCS, Go into Controls for the Mod plane, click on make html. Restart joypro.



My Tool crashes when assigning a button
Make sure you have the needed Requirements installed.


I have a bug?!

Contact me, I will try to fix it asap. 


# What features might come?

-Maybe other games come like star citizen, as that game is in its joystick mapping a mess inside the game. But if so, thats far out. 
(Right now im in the testing state how easy it is outside the game like IL2 or FS2020 or SC to change inputs)
-Refactoring at some point, prolly too much spaghetti for some :-D
