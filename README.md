# Joystick Profiler Utility

This utility is there in the current state to help, to quickly make the basic joystick Mappings for DCS world (Digital Combat Simulator).
It works by making relations between various inputs from various planes and bind them to the same place on the joystick.

You first create Relations. Within a single relation each airframe can only be once bound/active. Multiple different DCS key elements can conclude one relation. 
E.g. You have in some airframes Left Wheel Brake and a right Wheel brake. In some others you just have a Wheel break. So you can make now a relation that you would want on your
right paddle the right wheel brake and for those airframes that just have a general brake you want the general break there. 

You can export Relations to make other Peoples life easier, so they don't need to make Relations. 
Once you are happy with your Relation you can Bind an Axis or Button to it. 
However for simplicity sake the current version has some shortcomings, because I am not sure if i just coded that for me, or if more people find interest in such a utility.

If people show interest, I might update it and improve on the given shortcomings and improve the cleaness of the code and maybe extend to other games like Star citizen, but as I said for me it does the job right now. 
Use the program only at your own risk as you might overwrite some existing binds. Make some backup of your existing binds before you use the software, if you get disappointed, that you can roll back.

Anyways Good Success and Have a nice day.

# Windows X64 Builds: 

https://github.com/Holdi601/JoystickProfiler/tree/master/Builds 


# Requirements:
Microsoft C++ Redist 2010, 2011 and 2015 x64. I can't put a link here as they become deprecated after a few days. Google it yourself. Sorry.

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework .NET 4.5 or higher (newest always best)

DirectX11
Windows 10 or higher

SlimDX Requirements:
X64 Runtime:
https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/slimdx/SlimDX%20Runtime%20.NET%204.0%20x64%20(January%202012).msi

If that doesnâ€™t help maybe the SDK:
https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/slimdx/SlimDX%20SDK%20(January%202012).msi

And in general slimdx ressources can be found here in case the links are dead for you https://code.google.com/archive/p/slimdx/downloads but please when possible try to choose the x64 option as that is what JoyPro uses
